# HotelBreakfast
I created a menu of breakfast items for a fake/made-up hotel in a Java JFrame.

You can click on an item at the top and see the description of the item. You are able to order all three items and you'll see the receipt on the right side. In the middle panel, you can see when the mouse moves or enters/exits the middle panel. I think that was just an assignment requirement, to be honest.

If this was a UI that was actually used, there are a few QOL changes I would make:
  - Ability to order more than one of each menu item at a time
  - Make receipt easier to read
  - Readjust text windows to take up a more appropriate amount of space in the window
  - Change colors of UI
  - Be able to add modifiers to each item
